### Everything is aligned properly
- Idea to implement a mouse:onscroll or window:onscroll HostListener()
- Add y-position property, and index page for 5things that are on the page
- For the active thing card:
    - Scroll until y-value = 0,
    - Then switch to next active,
    - If last item, keep it like 50-100px from top,
    - Add popup to submit / move to top

- Easy enough ?
