# FiveThings
A web app to keep track of my daily life (five things at a time)

Since January 2016 I've been summarizing my day into five points. I started by hand writing them everyday, but life got too busy and so I began writing them down in google keep. After nearly a year and half of doing that I decided to make it into my own web app, enjoy!

### Try it out [HERE](https://five--things.herokuapp.com/)!


I also wrote some js code to convert my json to pdfs that printed into physical books. Find the pdf generating code in `` /pdf``

#### Todo's & Future Plans
* A template page where users can...  
  * select the book style they like
  * select a range of days they want printed
  * generate a PDF of those days in their chosen style
  * *(In progress [here](https://five--things.herokuapp.com/templates)!)*
* Analytics and Analysis
  * Sentiment analysis to determine if you had a good or bad day *(In progress [here](https://five--things.herokuapp.com/analyze)!)*
  * Graphs to show happiness over time
  * Fun stats about your month (longest day, shortest day, most referenced person, etc)
* Navigation Bar
* Settings Page
* Lots more templates! 
* A redesign to the journal entry page
